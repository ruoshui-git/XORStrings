Given three strings mode, text, and key: it will produce an output string by xor'ing corresponding values together.

input mode: human/numOut
input keyfile is extended ASCII text FILE
input textfile is extended ASCII text FILE
output is the xor'ed value of the text and the key string.

Note:
The output should be the same length as the text.
If the length of the keyfile is shorter than the textfile, loop the key string.

Usage:
    make run ARGS="mode keyfile textfile"
